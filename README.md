# ðŸ›’ EasyShop E-Commerce API â€“ Capstone Project

Welcome to the EasyShop API â€“ a Java Spring Boot application built as part of my third capstone for Java Development. This backend project powers an e-commerce platform that lets users browse products, manage categories, and handles user authentication.

The project connects to a MySQL database and focuses on fixing bugs and building out core features, especially around product categories.

Overview

EasyShop is an online store where users can explore products by category and (if they're admins) manage the system through protected endpoints.

This capstone focused on:
- Adding new endpoints to manage product categories
- Securing admin-only actions
- Fixing bugs in existing product-related features
